# VirtualBox-on-Android
This is my project environment for the Linux+ course


I wanted to use an existing piece of hardware that I had for the linux+ course on LinkedIn. The specifications for the course require that I have the latest Ubuntu Distro as well as VirtualBox which would be used to 
install Rocky Linux. 

This project contains my steps for a rootless installation of Ubuntu via Docker on an Android S8 Active.
